Do it right
-----------
- Separate your code from "Do it dynamic" to two different modules - Network & Compute.
- Add an option (using conditional statements) to provision only one Subnet and one EC2 instance.
- Provision one environment for "Dev" and one for "Prod", from the same terraform project, using your modules.


To hand in
----------
All your terraform files, inside a folder named `<your-name>-doitright`, which is zipped as `<your-name>-doitright.zip`.
Meaning, when unzipping your file, the result is a directory named `<your-name>-doitright` which contains all the relevant files.


Note
----
Remember to destroy your AWS resources at the end of the day - they cost money! ;)
